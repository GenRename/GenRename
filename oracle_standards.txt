Oracle: Java Code Conventions (Chapter 9)
Classes
•	Naming Convention: Use nouns in CapCase (also known as Upper Camel Case), capitalizing the first letter of each internal word.
•	Guidelines:
•	Keep class names simple and descriptive.
•	Use whole words and avoid acronyms unless the acronym is more recognized than the full term (e.g., URL, HTML).
Interfaces
•	Naming Convention: Follow the same capitalization rules as class names.
•	Guidelines:
•	Name interfaces with nouns or adjectives that describe their behavior.
Methods
•	Naming Convention: Use verbs in camelCase, starting with a lowercase letter, and capitalize the first letter of each internal word.
•	Guidelines:
•	Method names should clearly indicate their action.
Variables
•	Naming Convention: Use camelCase with a lowercase first letter. Internal words start with capital letters.
•	Guidelines:
•	Names should be short yet meaningful and mnemonic to indicate the intent of their use.
•	Avoid one-character variable names, except for temporary variables often used in loops or simple iterations.
Constants
•	Naming Convention: Use ALL_UPPERCASE with words separated by underscores.
•	Guidelines:
•	Suitable for variables declared as class constants.
•	Avoid ANSI constants to facilitate debugging.
