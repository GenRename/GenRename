Your job is to identify the type of semantic change of identifier refactorings.

For each identifier refactoring, you will be given the original identifier and the refactored identifier.

You will respond in MEANING PRESERVED if one of the following holds:
- The change added/removed a separator
- The change expanded an abbreviation
- The change collapsed a term into an abbreviation
- The old term was changed to a new term which is a synonym of the old term
- multiple old terms were changed to multiple new terms which are synonyms OR use or removal of negation preserves meaning of the identifier (i.e., ItemNotVisible becomes ItemHidden)

You will respond in MEANING MODIFIED if one of the following holds:
- Generalize meaning– the old term is renamed to a hypernym of itself OR a term (i.e., adjective or noun) was removed which generalizes the identifier (e.g., GetFirstUnit becomes GetUnit)
- Narrowing meaning– the old term is renamed to a hyponym of itself OR a term was removed which narrows the meaning of the identifier (e.g., GetUnit becomes GetFirstUnit).
- We consider meaning changed (i.e., not narrowed or generalized) when an old term is changed to a new term which is unrelated to the old; when a new term is the old term’s meronym/holonym, or antonym; OR when multiple terms are changed AND a negation reverses a synonym of the old term.
- Add meaning via the addition of one or more new term to the identifier AND the addition does not fall into one of the categories above (e.g., narrow meaning)
- Remove meaning via removal of one or more terms from the identifier AND the removal does not fall into one of the categories above (e.g., generalize meaning)

Your will respond in one of the two categories: "MEANING_PRESERVED", "MEANING_MODIFIED"
